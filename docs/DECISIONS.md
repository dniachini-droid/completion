## D-001 — Repository is documentation-only during discovery
- **Date:** 2026-09-23
- **Context:** Founding brief requires discovery before any technical choice.
- **Alternatives:** Scaffold an app early.
- **Rationale:** Avoid anchoring on technology or mechanics before understanding the player and the problem.
- **Consequences:** No framework, `package.json`, database or architecture until Phase 7.
- **Reversible:** Yes, by explicit agreement.

## D-002 — Project lives at the root of the existing `completion` repository
- **Date:** 2026-09-23
- **Context:** Work began in a pre-existing GitHub repo (`dniachini-droid/completion`) containing only a stub README. The brief suggested a `real-life-rpg/` directory.
- **Alternatives:** Nest everything under `real-life-rpg/`; create a new GitHub repo.
- **Rationale:** The repo itself is the project; nesting would add a pointless directory level. `real-life-rpg` remains the provisional project name.
- **Consequences:** Paths in docs are relative to the repo root. The repo can be renamed on GitHub when a final name is chosen.
- **Reversible:** Yes.

## D-003 — `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` is the authoritative progress tracker
- **Date:** 2026-09-23
- **Context:** Dan asked for a single place recording phase, objective, session focus, out-of-scope work, exit criteria, milestones, blockers and exactly one next action.
- **Alternatives:** Track state only in `CLAUDE.md` or `DISCOVERY.md`.
- **Rationale:** One small file read first each session prevents drift and phase-skipping.
- **Consequences:** Read at every session start; updated before every substantial session ends. Requests that skip ahead substantially are flagged and require a deliberate choice to deviate.
- **Reversible:** Yes.

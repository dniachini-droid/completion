## D-001 — Repository is documentation-only during discovery
- **Date:** 2026-09-23
- **Context:** Founding brief requires discovery before any technical choice.
- **Alternatives:** Scaffold an app early.
- **Rationale:** Avoid anchoring on technology or mechanics before understanding the player and the problem.
- **Consequences:** No framework, `package.json`, database or architecture until Phase 7.
- **Reversible:** Yes, by explicit agreement.

## D-002 — Project lives at the root of the existing `completion` repository
- **Date:** 2026-09-23
- **Context:** Work began in a pre-existing GitHub repo (`dniachini-droid/completion`) containing only a stub README. The brief suggested a `real-life-rpg/` directory.
- **Alternatives:** Nest everything under `real-life-rpg/`; create a new GitHub repo.
- **Rationale:** The repo itself is the project; nesting would add a pointless directory level. `real-life-rpg` remains the provisional project name.
- **Consequences:** Paths in docs are relative to the repo root. The repo can be renamed on GitHub when a final name is chosen.
- **Reversible:** Yes.

## D-003 — `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` is the authoritative progress tracker
- **Date:** 2026-09-23
- **Context:** Dan asked for a single place recording phase, objective, session focus, out-of-scope work, exit criteria, milestones, blockers and exactly one next action.
- **Alternatives:** Track state only in `CLAUDE.md` or `DISCOVERY.md`.
- **Rationale:** One small file read first each session prevents drift and phase-skipping.
- **Consequences:** Read at every session start; updated before every substantial session ends. Requests that skip ahead substantially are flagged and require a deliberate choice to deviate.
- **Reversible:** Yes.

## D-004 — Pragmatic pre-production; first playable prioritised
- **Date:** 2026-09-23
- **Context:** Dan clarified that Phases 0–5 must not attempt to perfect the eventual game before implementation.
- **Decision:** Phases 0–5 are thorough but pragmatic. Do enough discovery to understand Dan and settle the core game concept, then prioritise a small but beautiful first playable. Deep worldbuilding and narrative continue in parallel once the core loop is proven.
- **Alternatives:** Complete full narrative and world design (Phase 3) before any implementation, as a strict reading of the brief implies.
- **Rationale:** The central behavioural hypothesis (does wanting to progress the world make Dan start real actions?) can only be tested with something playable. Over-designing first risks the "project so enormous I never use it" anti-goal.
- **Consequences:** Phase 3, before the first playable, is scoped to the thematic core, world rules, the central mystery's hidden answer, and the truth behind every clue the playable plants. Later arcs, factions and secondary mysteries are designed in parallel afterwards. The "truth before clues" rule is unchanged, but it applies per clue rather than requiring the whole world to be finished first. The phase order stays the same.
- **Reversible:** Yes.

## D-005 — Phase 0 closed; Phase 1 begins
- **Date:** 2026-09-23
- **Context:** Six interview rounds; all 12 exit criteria answered (see the synthesis table in `DISCOVERY.md`). Dan confirmed the player model: "This is fantastic. Yes."
- **Alternatives:** More interview rounds on structure, notifications and failure handling.
- **Rationale:** The latest answers showed diminishing returns ("don't know", "we could try"). Those questions are better answered by observing Dan with a prototype (D-004).
- **Consequences:** Low-confidence areas (criteria 9, 11, 12) are carried as hypotheses to test in use. Phase 1 (Product Discovery) starts.
- **Reversible:** Discovery can be reopened at any time if the model proves wrong.

## D-006 — Working agreement: Claude directs the build and safeguards the work
- **Date:** 2026-09-23
- **Context:** Dan has no coding background and asked Claude to save work automatically, handle PRs, direct the build, and say when to start new sessions.
- **Decision:** Claude commits and pushes after every meaningful step. At each Dan-approved phase or slice end, it opens a PR into `main` and merges it. It tells Dan when to start a new session and what to paste. It makes routine technical choices itself, recorded here, and asks Dan only about taste, priorities and personal knowledge.
- **Alternatives:** Dan manages PRs and merges himself.
- **Rationale:** Removes admin from Dan (anti productivity theatre) and keeps continuity in the repo rather than in chat.
- **Consequences:** `main` is the source of truth between sessions. Feature branches are short-lived.
- **Reversible:** Yes.
